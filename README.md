# Mood Jar - Your Digital Mood Tracker

## Project Description

Mood Jar is a simple and personal Flutter application designed to help you track your daily moods.  Think of it as a digital version of a mood jar where you can drop in your feelings each day.  The app aims to provide a quick and easy way to log your mood, allowing you to visualize trends and gain insights into your emotional well-being over time.

This project is built with Flutter, utilizing Hive for local data storage to keep your mood data private and accessible offline.
